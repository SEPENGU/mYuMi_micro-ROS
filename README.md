# MICRO-ROS FOR MOBILE ROBOTICS SYSTEMS

Project to put micro-ROS into ABB's mobile YuMi platform (mYuMi), conducted as a 30 hp master's thesis for MÃ¤lardalen University.

This is the guide on how to set up the full system with mYuMi.

The micro-ROS setup guides for integration into external tools can be read as standalone for extra help on top of the already existing micro-ROS guides.

## Setup guide

All guides assumes the use of Ubuntu 20.04 as the OS, Galactic as the version for micro-ROS and ROS2, Fast DDS as the middleware for ROS2, and Micro XRCE-DDS as the middleware for micro-ROS.
